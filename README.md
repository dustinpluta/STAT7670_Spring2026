### Catalog Course Description

>This course is designed as a first course in multivariate analysis, with emphasis on learning theoretical concepts and corresponding analytical tools in R. Topics to be covered include: discrete and continuous multivariate distributions, MANOVA, multivariate multiple regression, principal component analysis, discriminant analysis, canonical correlation analysis, dimension reduction methods such as multidimensional scaling and stochastic neighborhood embedding, data visualization, Gaussian graphical models and high dimensional inference. Upon successful completion of the course, the students will have sufficient practical knowledge for analyzing any multivariate data set. In this course, topics relevant to modern day problems in big data analysis are discussed and the multivariate tools necessary to tackle them are discussed.

### Course Evaluation and Grading

#### Assessments

- 5 Homework Assignments **(49%)**
- 1 Midterm Exam **(19%)**
- 1 Course Project **(29%)**
- Professionalism **(3%)**

##### Homework Assignments

- Homework assignments consist of a combination of theory and application problems based on the lecture and book material, and involve, e.g., coding, mathematical derivations, and interpreting model results.
- Due date will typically be 1 - 2 weeks after it is assigned.
- Late assignments will not be accepted without prior approval.
- Your submitted assignments should be organized, with the assignment number, your name, and the date all clearly visible on the first page. 
- Any results, derivations, or any other form of work you include that is not your own must be cited with a full reference.
- I **strongly** prefer you type your assignments using $\LaTeX$ or Markdown.
- Homework submission will occur online.  See the course webpage for further instructions.

##### Midterm Exam

- In-class, closed book, one page of notes (standard letter paper, front and back).
- Questions similar to homework assignments.
- Specific material covered and further details on the exam will be provided in class.

##### Course Project

Students will be tasked with conducting a thorough analysis on a real world data set, producing a written report that includes a practical interpretation of results. Students will need to: find a real world data set, identify a question of interest that can be assessed with the data, develop and apply the appropriate set of methods from the course, and interpret the analysis results in the context of the motivating question.  Students will be required to make use of statistical modeling software (R, Python) to conduct their analyses and generate the required plots.

##### Professionalism

For full credit in this category you must consistently attend class and complete the course evaluations at the end of the term. 

#### Grading Scale

A-F Grading Scale:

A: >= 90% & <= 100% 

B: >= 80% & < 90% 

C: >= 70% & < 80% 

D: >= 60% & < 70% 

F: < 60%
